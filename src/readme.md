**Polygon Application**

**Description**

This is a Java application utilising Java Swing for drawing a polygon with user-defined properties. The program collects inputs for the number of sides, angles, radius, and colour, then renders the shape on a canvas.  Java Swing, a lightweight toolkit for building graphical interfaces, is ideal for this task due to its components like JFrame, JPanel, and JComboBox. The application can feature a JFrame as the main window, containing input fields (JTextField for sides, angles, and radius), a JComboBox for selecting colors (black, red, green, orange, yellow, blue), and a button to trigger rendering. A custom JPanel serves as the drawing canvas, overriding its paintComponent method to draw the polygon using Javaâ€™s 2D graphics API (Graphics2D).
